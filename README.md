# Jasmine Unit Testing

This project is an exercise to make practice on Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) using Jasmine and to work on this principle with a very simple project.
It consists of writing the tests and then the code for some functions to complete a basic game.
To play the game, a user must use the arrow keys and make the player reach the honey pot on the board.
